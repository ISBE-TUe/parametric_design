You do it with groups of three; ideally, an experienced parametric designer is present in each group. It is recommended to do the assignment with Rhino+Grasshopper. Alternatively, it can also be done with Dynamo and Revit, but then it needs to be motivated and approved beforehand. The lectures and individual assignments will be in Grasshopper. Grades are given per group, not individually. So, each group member in a group has the same grade. Work together. Experiment with the parametric scripting tools at your availability.
