# Beethoven Project

The parametric design assignment of this year takes place on Campus, within the context of the Beethoven Project. The assignment focuses on the design of two interconnected buildings that support the growth of research and innovation at TU/e.

The project consists of:

1. A main building containing laboratories, offices, and public-facing spaces related to open science and exhibitions.
1. A cleanroom building, connected to the main building via a bridge.

The assignment is inspired by recent developments within the Beethoven growth initiative at TU/e, as described in the following articles:

The planned buildings can be seen in this image:

These articles should be used as contextual and conceptual references, not as strict design templates.

This is a group assignment. You will work in groups of three students. Ideally, each group contains at least one student with prior experience in parametric design.

It is highly recommended to carry out this assignment using Rhino + Grasshopper. Alternatively, Dynamo + Revit may be used, but only if this choice is clearly motivated and approved in advance. The lectures and individual assignments in the course are based on Grasshopper.

Grades are given per group, not individually. Each group member receives the same grade.

Work together. Experiment with the parametric scripting tools available to you. Collaboration, exploration, and creativity are key aspects of this assignment.

## Programmatic Requirements

The design consists of two main buildings:

1. Main Building — Labs, Offices, and Public Interface

The main building accommodates laboratories and office spaces, while its ground level functions as a fully public, open, and accessible interface with the campus and city.

Inspired by the spatial strategies of the Phaeno Science Center and the Porsche Museum, the building is lifted on expressive structural elements (e.g. pillars or cores). This allows the ground level to remain visually and physically porous, creating a gradual transition from open exterior space into the building rather than a clearly defined threshold.

![Porsche Museum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Porsche-Museum_Main_Entrance.JPG/2560px-Porsche-Museum_Main_Entrance.JPG)

These structural elements should not remain purely tectonic. Instead, they are encouraged to transform into functional spatial components, similar to how circulation and structural elements in the EPFL Library become inhabitable study and interaction spaces. Columns, cores, ramps, or lifts may thus evolve into informal seating areas, micro-workspaces, exhibition niches, or gathering points.

### Ground-Level Public Zone

The ground floor is conceived as an active public layer that supports community engagement and open science activities. Possible functions include:

- Open science event and presentation areas
- Exhibition and demonstration spaces
- Informal gathering and social interaction zones
- Maker spaces and workshop areas accessible to the public

This level should remain visually continuous with the surrounding open space and reinforce accessibility, transparency, and inclusivity.

Privacy and Access Gradient

The building incorporates two clearly articulated levels of privacy: 1. Public Zone (Ground Level): Fully accessible, open to the community, and designed to support events, exhibitions, and informal use. 2. Intermediate Access Zone (Upper Levels): Semi-public areas accessed via controlled vertical circulation. These spaces support collaboration, learning, and work but are not freely accessible to the general public.

Laboratories and offices are positioned deeper within or higher in the building, ensuring appropriate separation while maintaining visual and spatial connections where relevant.

Architectural Expression

The building should explicitly communicate its parametric logic in three dimensions, both structurally and spatially. Geometry, structure, and circulation are expected to work together to produce a compelling spatial experience that clearly reflects computational and parametric design principles.

2. Cleanroom Building

The second building is a cleanroom facility, which connects to the main building via a bridge structure. The cleanroom building must be spatially and functionally distinct, yet clearly related to the main building through geometry, structure, or parametric logic.

This area is often the most private part of the complex. The cleanroom building is not expected to be visited by external people. However, the comfort of the researchers during their access to the building should be adressed. You do not need to bother about the actual cleanroom part, you are not expected to deal with cleanroom functions!

3. Tunnel connection

As an optional extra, you can work on the connection between these two buildings.

## Functional and Performance Requirements

The overall design solution must meet the following requirements:

The shape of both buildings is not flat and shows a clear three-dimensional parametric character.

The solution needs to be attractive, comfortable, and representative of TU/e’s ambitions in research, innovation, and open science.

The design must address practical performance aspects, including:
• acoustics
• temperature control
• fresh air
• daylight

## Construction and Realism

- Components of the design must reasonably be able to reach their final on-site location (e.g. truck size, crane access).
- The components of the design must be fabricable.
- Construction detailing should clearly indicate how key components are joined together.
- The design solution must be structurally stable.
- The design must be able to resist Dutch weather conditions (rain, snow, wind, sun).
- Be creative, but remain realistic.

Themes

Furthermore, choose one of the following themes as a source of inspiration. This can motivate specific design decisions, parametric strategies, or the use of particular plug-ins or tools.

- Circularity
- Construction Tech
- Comfort & Health
- Element of Surprise
- Other

## Task and Submission

Do the following to complete the assignment:

1. Make three sample design solutions, using one and the same parametric script, but with different sets of parameters. Demonstrate how these alternatives fit within the target site. These designs do not need to be fully detailed and serve as proof of concept. The three alternatives are presented at the intermediate presentation.
1. Choose one preferred design solution and develop it into a full design proposal.
1. Indicate in the report which plug-ins and modules you used, why you used them, and how they supported your design process.
1. Avoid relying on manually modelled geometry. The parametric logic should drive the design.
1. Combine multiple 3D components into one complete design using Speckle. You may use multiple scripts if needed. Use your group folder in Speckle to collaborate.
1. Generate a list of components with relevant dimensions to support fabrication and construction. This list should clarify what is needed to build your project.
1. Write a concise report (approximately 20–30 pages) describing your design, parametric logic, and design process. Prepare a presentation explaining your final design and how you arrived there.
1. Optionally, you may:
   • 3D print a small-scale physical model, or
   • present your work in virtual reality (VR).
1. Upload the final result to Speckle at the same project location provided. Use Speckle for collaboration as well. Preferably use the provided project folder; alternatively, create your own project folder. Include the Speckle URL in the final report so the project can be visualised directly in the browser.

Make a .zip file containing:
• the report,
• the presentation,
• all Grasshopper files.

Upload this file to Canvas. The file name must be:

Group_XX_YY.zip

where XX is your group number and YY is your project name.

## Presentation

There are two presentation moments for this assignment: an intermediate presentation (week 4), and a final presentation (week 7). On both occasions, each group presents their work for the entire group, on campus. A jury is present on both occasions.
