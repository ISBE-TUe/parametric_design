## How to do the assignments and course?


- The process is more important than the outcome!
- “When the outcome drives the process, we will only ever go to where we’ve
- already been. If process drives the outcome, we may not know where we’re
- going, but we will know we want to be there.”
- Explore!
- (Incomplete Manifesto for growth: Bruce Mau)

## Student Event Location: Design Brief


The pavilion brings together 'TUe students on campus’
It allows the organisation of large outdoor events, as
they happen now as well, yet in this case including also a
canopy structure and facilities.
about half of the area needs to be covered.
a bar and resto infrastructure needs to be present, as
well as toilets, storage space and power supply.
A stage area needs to be included, for events
limited housing is to be provided as well. These student
rooms are private and accessible unrelated to the
event.

## Student Event Location: Requirements



The student event location is not flat and shows clear 3D parametric shape.
Your solution includes several student facilities: a bar and resto area, sanitary
facilities, storage space, and power supply.
Your solution also includes a residential student area, where an optimal
number of student rooms is made available, with separate access and
privacy.
Your solution needs to be attractive and comfortable for students.
The area needs to be practical, innovating and representative for TUe. This
also includes factors like acoustics, temperature, fresh air, and light.

## Design it so that it can be built



Components of the design can reasonably get to their final on-site
location (truck size, crane, etc.);
The components of the design can be fabricated;
Make clear with construction details how different key components are
joined together;
Your design solution must be structurally stable (approximate – no
calculations);
Your design solution must be able to resist Dutch weather (rain, snow,
wind, sun);
Be creative and realistic.

## Important details


This is a group assignment. You do it with groups of three; ideally, an
experienced parametric designer is present in each group.
It is recommended to do the assignment with Rhino+Grasshopper.
Alternatively, it can also be done with Dynamo and Revit, but then it needs
to be motivated and approved beforehand. The lectures and individual
assignments will be in Grasshopper.
Grades are given per group, not individually. So, each group member in a
group has the same grade.
Work together. Experiment with the parametric scripting tools at your
availability. Collaboration and creativity are key!

## For guidance and inspiration: Choose a theme



Furthermore, choose one of the following themes as a source of
inspiration. This can motivate you to work with one or the other plugins
and tools, or it can motivate certain design choices.
Theme 1: Circular Green
Theme 2: Construction Tech
Theme 3: Comfort & Health
Theme 4: Element of Surprise
Theme 5: Other

## Some basic rules – things that I look for


- Avoid all Boolean operations (union, intersect, etc)

1.
Group input parameters to the left of the diagram
2.
Always use Groups to collect blocks of your script
3.
Use Scribble notes to indicate how the script works and should be used
4.
Organise your script such that all blocks are nicely aligned and it is easy to
follow the wires and nodes
5.
Give your input parameters meaningful names that are not 'number slider'
6.
Use hidden wire display as soon as very long wires appear - and still make it
clear that there is an output-input there.
7.
Use colours.
8.
Avoid random input parameters, e,g. Voronoi, Random, GraphMapper
9.
Use Panels to keep track of your intermediate inputs and outputs

## What is parametric design?



“Design begins with the conscious or unconscious attribution of values to parameters
describing functional requirements of the object and the constraints that limit the range of
possible design solutions. As the design progresses, further parameters are introduced
describing the dimensions of the object and potentially physical properties to be used for
its construction. The term parametric design is used ……. to mean the use of a computer to
automatically modify a design as the values of parameters change and to make
corresponding changes to the models during the design process.”

Hudson R. Strategies for parametric design in architecture.

<small>PhD thesis, University of Bath, 2010.</small>




---

## How does it work?

### Parametric design

1. Describe the initial state;
1. This state will be modified according to <span class="text-red-700"> a number of variables
(parameters); </span>
1. The outcome is evaluated by the designer and the parameters are adjusted;
1. This new state, derived in step 2, becomes the initial state for the next iteration.

## Grasshopper intro



Grasshopper ≠ programming
Grasshopper = visual programming
Grasshopper is about manipulating data and lists
There is more than one route to the outcome
Data flows from left to right -> NO loops
What happens in Grasshopper stays in Grasshopper
unless you bake the outcome into Rhino



<!-- Placeholder: slide visual extracted from PDF page 58 -->
<!-- ![](./images/page_058.png) -->

## Rhino and Grasshopper - installation


Go to https://www.rhino3d.com/download
Download the correct and latest version:
not the free trial, but the one that requires
a license key
Install…
Start Rhino
Enter your TUe email address and agree to
conditions, and click Next/OK
In the “Prepare to license” step, click on
“Options” in the left-bottom
Click “Use the LAN Zoo”


<!-- Placeholder: slide visual extracted from PDF page 59 -->
<!-- ![](./images/page_059.png) -->

---

## Use the Zoo



Make sure that you are connected to the TUe
network (use the VPN)
Set the Zoo Server to the local TUe campus
server: rhinoceros.lic.tue.nl
These are educational licenses for the Dept. of
the Built Environment
You are up and running with Rhino!

## And Grasshopper?



Grasshopper is included
in Rhino 7/8
Start by typing
‘grasshopper’ in the
command line
A new window pops up,
that interacts with Rhino
