An optimal path over the Groene Loper
In this individual assignment, you are expected to use a combination of Galapagos and C# coding, with the coding part supported by ChatGPT or similar. These tools you need to use with the objective to "make an optimal path over the Groene Loper, incl. decorations along the pathway". In this assignment, you do not use Speckle.

Task
Part 1: Create parametric start setup
Create a starting line and a finish line, for example both with length 150m and 500m apart
Add a number of buildings (e.g. 2-3) between starting line and finish line
Make sure that your setup is parametric to a reasonable degree, so that your Pathfinder algorithm can be executed on different scenarios.
Part 2: Galapagos Pathfinder algorithm:
Find a pathway that goes from starting line to finish line with a minimum width of 1m. Width is preferably adjustable as well.
Find the most optimal pathway that does not intersect with the inserted buildings. This can be the shortest pathway. More complicated optimization functions or targets should be limited and reserved for the group assignment.
Make sure to explain the fitness function (= expression) in detail, including inputs and potential weight factors, and including your choice for genetic algorithm versus simulated annealing. What is the difference?
Part 3: C# coding
In the final step, the pathway is to be 'decorated' or 'finalised' with code-generated content. You can choose what you want to add; this can be a sequence of arches, lantern posts, trees, a fence, benches, or similar, as long as the geometry is created using the C# component, and the resulting artefacts are placed along the generated pathway.
For this part, you must use a C# node in Grasshopper.
You are advised to rely on ChatGPT, but of course you can modify the C# script, incl. input and output parameters.
You have to document your code in the report and indicate how it functions. Which parts did you re-use, which parts did you modify? Which variables are hardcoded, and which are input parameters.
Submission
Submit the following:

A PDF report documentation and key findings (+/- 3-4 pages). Place the generated code in Annex.
Your Grasshopper script.
Note: you don't have to wait until the submission deadline to submit your work. Plan yourself as good as possible in combination with your group assignment.
