Beethoven Project

The parametric design assignment of this year takes place on Campus, within the context of the Beethoven Project. The assignment focuses on the design of two interconnected buildings that support the growth of research, innovation, and open science at TU/e.

The project consists of: 1. A main building containing laboratories, offices, and public-facing spaces related to open science and exhibitions. 2. A cleanroom building, connected to the main building via a bridge.

The assignment is inspired by recent developments within the Beethoven growth initiative at TU/e, as described in the following articles:
• TU/e invests 200 million in new lab building and cleanroom building

• TU/e straight off the mark to realize Beethoven growth

These articles should be used as contextual and conceptual references, not as strict design templates.

This is a group assignment. You will work in groups of three students. Ideally, each group contains at least one student with prior experience in parametric design.

It is highly recommended to carry out this assignment using Rhino + Grasshopper. Alternatively, Dynamo + Revit may be used, but only if this choice is clearly motivated and approved in advance. The lectures and individual assignments in the course are based on Grasshopper.

Grades are given per group, not individually. Each group member receives the same grade.

Work together. Experiment with the parametric scripting tools available to you. Collaboration, exploration, and creativity are key aspects of this assignment.

Programmatic Requirements

The design consists of two main buildings:

1. Main Building — Labs, Offices, and Public Space

The main building accommodates laboratories and offices, but its ground level must function as a public and accessible space. Inspired by the Phaeno Science Center, the building should be lifted on structural elements (e.g. pillars), allowing the ground floor to gradually transition into the building.

This ground-level public zone can include:
• open science event areas
• exhibition spaces
• informal gathering and interaction zones

The building should clearly express its parametric logic in three dimensions and provide a compelling spatial experience.

2. Cleanroom Building

The second building is a cleanroom facility, which connects to the main building via a bridge structure. The cleanroom building must be spatially and functionally distinct, yet clearly related to the main building through geometry, structure, or parametric logic.

Functional and Performance Requirements

The overall design solution must meet the following requirements:

The shape of both buildings is not flat and shows a clear three-dimensional parametric character.

The solution needs to be attractive, comfortable, and representative of TU/e’s ambitions in research, innovation, and open science.

The design must address practical performance aspects, including:
• acoustics
• temperature control
• fresh air
• daylight

⸻

Construction and Realism

Furthermore:

Components of the design must reasonably be able to reach their final on-site location (e.g. truck size, crane access).

The components of the design must be fabricable.

Construction detailing should clearly indicate how key components are joined together.

The design solution must be structurally stable.

The design must be able to resist Dutch weather conditions (rain, snow, wind, sun).

Be creative, but remain realistic.

⸻

Themes

Furthermore, choose one of the following themes as a source of inspiration. This can motivate specific design decisions, parametric strategies, or the use of particular plug-ins or tools.
• Circularity
• Construction Tech
• Comfort & Health
• Element of Surprise
• Other

⸻

Task and Submission

Do the following to complete the assignment:

Make three sample design solutions, using one and the same parametric script, but with different sets of parameters. Demonstrate how these alternatives fit within the target site. These designs do not need to be fully detailed and serve as proof of concept. The three alternatives are presented at the intermediate presentation.

Choose one preferred design solution and develop it into a full design proposal.

Indicate in the report which plug-ins and modules you used, why you used them, and how they supported your design process.

Avoid relying on manually modelled geometry. The parametric logic should drive the design.

Combine multiple 3D components into one complete design using Speckle. You may use multiple scripts if needed. Use your group folder in Speckle to collaborate.

Generate a list of components with relevant dimensions to support fabrication and construction. This list should clarify what is needed to build your project.

Write a concise report (approximately 20–30 pages) describing your design, parametric logic, and design process. Prepare a presentation explaining your final design and how you arrived there.

Optionally, you may:
• 3D print a small-scale physical model, or
• present your work in virtual reality (VR).

Upload the final result to Speckle at the same project location provided. Use Speckle for collaboration as well. Preferably use the provided project folder; alternatively, create your own project folder. Include the Speckle URL in the final report so the project can be visualised directly in the browser.

Make a .zip file containing:
• the report,
• the presentation,
• all Grasshopper files.

Upload this file to Canvas. The file name must be:

Group_XX_YY.zip

where XX is your group number and YY is your project name.

The parametric design assignment of this year takes place on Campus, at "The Groene Loper". On this location, we will build an event location with canopy or partial roof structure and several student-centric facilities. The new event location needs to be representative of TUe Student Life and have a compelling 3D geometric shape. It needs to fit between the current buildings and maintain sufficient open and green space. The amount of green space should not become less.

The pavilion brings together 'TUe students on campus' and allows the organisation of large outdoor events, as they happen now as well, yet in this case including also a canopy structure and facilities. It needs to have about half of the area covered. Furthermore, a bar and resto infrastructure needs to be present, as well as toilets, storage space and power supply, collectively to be managed and used by students. A stage area needs to be included, for events. In addition to the event location, limited housing is to be provided as well: an optimal number of student rooms is to be included, as part of your design. These student rooms are private and accessible unrelated to the event.

This is a group assignment. You do it with groups of three; ideally, an experienced parametric designer is present in each group. It is highly recommended to do the assignment with Rhino+Grasshopper. Alternatively, it can also be done with Dynamo and Revit, but then it needs to be motivated and approved beforehand. The lectures will be based on Grasshopper; also individual assignments need to be done with Rhino+Grasshopper. Grades are given per group, not individually. So, each group member in a group has the same grade. Work together. Experiment with the parametric scripting tools at your availability. Collaboration and creativity are key!

Design brief
Use Parametric Design software to design a "Groene Loper" student event location with the following scope:

Your design solution needs to be located within the boundaries of the Groene Loper.
Surrounding existing building need to be kept intact.
Existing furniture and trees can be relocated and modified, yet the original Groene Loper needs to be 'recognizable' still.
The following requirements need to be met by the design solution:

The shape of the student event location is not flat and shows clear 3D parametric shape.
Your solution includes several student facilities: a bar and resto area, sanitary facilities, storage space, and power supply.
Your solution includes also a residential student area, where an optimal number of student rooms is made available, with separate access and privacy.
Your solution needs to be attractive and comfortable for students.
The area needs to be practical, innovating and representative for TUe. This also includes factors like acoustics, temperature, fresh air, and light.
Furthermore:
