# Assignment 2: Midterm presentation

Present the current status of your work and design in a 7-minute presentation (Thursday, the 13th of March) + 3 minutes for questions and suggestions. Your current status needs to be rather advanced already (incl. script), since there are only three weeks left.

Make sure to include the following items in your presentation:

- Who you are
- Which theme do you focus on
- Your overall design approach and concept
- How you are using parametric design tools to achieve your goals
- Current overview of scripts and design
- Expected or targeted results

Take care of the following:

- Your presentation should be max. 7 slides, so that you stay within time.
- After the presentation in the lecture, submit your presentation, current state files, and optionally additional material via Canvas as a ZIP-folder.
- Each of you is requested to do peer review, through Canvas. One person gives feedback to one person, across project teams, within block. You will know before the start of the midterm presentation who you need to give feedback to. Use this to give constructive tips and hints to your fellow students about what they do as a group.
